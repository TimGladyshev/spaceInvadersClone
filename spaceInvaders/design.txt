Level Accomlished:
    Aiming for A+

Bullet-Point Summary:

    Important!!!
    Sound will only work on windows machines
    I kept the 10 enemies, but game works more smoothly with 5

    Also , please note a couple deviations from the rules
    (1) The alpha alien is not killable, but will get enraged and come closer
        if fired upon. It will still kill on contact with floor or player.
    (2) Aliens shoot own projectiles. Alpha damage *3 to barrier
    (3) Speed will increase with every wave of aliens
    
    Classes:

        I didnt end up really needing the classes I created, but kept them
        around for flexibility.
        
        Enemy:
            Creates a hostile turtle, defaulting to the little alien image
            Attributes
                health - health points (didnt end up using)
                alive - whther or not this object is considered 'in play'
                class global attribute - enemy_speed
            Methods
                __init__, __str__, & __eg__
                is_collition - finds distance between itself and another turtle
                                returns true if close

        Player
            Creates a player at the botton of the screen
            Attributes
                player_speed - speed at which the ship moves on arrow keys
                health - also didnt end up using
            Methods
                __init__, __str__, & __eg__
                is_collition - finds distance between itself and another turtle
                                returns true if close

        Bullet
            Ctreates a bullet
            Attributes
                state_a - whether the bullet is in the process of firing
            Methods
                is_collision - finds distance between itself and another turtle
                                returns true if close

    Data Structures:
        
        I got away with just working with lists on this one
    
    Functions:
        
        def fire_bullet()
            takes no parmas. switches state of bullet to active, and sets location

Summary:
    
    I wrote no functions that needed unit testing. I checked as much as I could
    as I coded, making sure each type of turtle was collidable and triggered the
    right outcomes.

    aliens, spaceship, barriers and projectiles I drew myself
    background and sound of web
